# data_collection-challenge
Module 11 Weekly Challenge

Hello!

I found the first part of this challenge to be straightforward and very similar to the examples we covered in class, which I greatly appreciated. I struggled a little bit in the second part when trying to extract the data using Beautiful Soup and Splinter. I was able to pull the Mars table data this way but I spent a lot of time trying to format it correctly without the \n's. Ultimately, I ended up scraping the table using pandas since I find it to be much more straightforward. However, I did leave my attempt at the Beautiful Soup/Splinter scraping in the Jupyter Notebook for reference. Thanks!
